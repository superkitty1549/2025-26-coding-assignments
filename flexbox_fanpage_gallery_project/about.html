            <h1>About Nightcord at 25:00</h1>
            <p>The mysterious and kinda depressed music group that writes music at 25:00 (aka 1 AM)...</p>

                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p>Nightcord at 25:00 started with K (Kanade) recruiting Enanan (Ena), Amia (Mizuki), and Yuki (Mafuyu) using an anonymous online chat tool called Nightcord. Until chapter 6 of their story, they never knew who they were irl.</p>
                <p>One day, Kanade loses contact with one of her circle members. They found a song file named "Untitled" that was shared with each of them, and upon playing it, they were transported to the Empty SEKAI.</p>

                <h2>Key event</h2>
                <p>The biggest event that has happened regarding this music group is Mizi5. In the game, each character have their own separate storylines. Each year, there is a new chapter released (Mizi1 -> Mizi2 -> Mizi3, etc.) Mizi5 refers to the 5th chapter of Mizuki's storyline. </p>
                <p>In Mizi5, cultural festival comes up and N25 decides to go together. During the festival, they all separate. Mizuki (who has this super big dark secret) is about to tell her big secret to Ena (her best friend, who is also in Nightcord at 25:00) when some random kid runs up and jokingly says, "Oh, you're Mizuki's friend? are you a guy too?". Ena is confused and asks what the kid means, and then it hits her. She looks back at Mizuki who freaks out and runs away. Ever since this, Mizuki has not appeared in any of the area conversations.</p>
                <p>Below is a picture of the Mizi5 card.</p>
